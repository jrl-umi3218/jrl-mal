Description: JRL matrix abstract layer
 The JRL matrix abstraction layer allows the design of generic algorithm
 which can use any underlying matrix manipulation library.
 The goal is to be able to insert the algorithm in any framework using its
 native numerical types without the conversion cost.
 .
 This package contains development files (headers and pkg-config file).
